    "text": "The BioSound Working Group\nThe BioSound working group is composed of various scientists and stakeholders interested in producing acoustic-based data products that support marine biodiversity monitoring and conservation. BioSound is particularly interested in understanding the value of underwater soundscape metrics as indicators of biological and anthropogenic change in the context of biodiversity conservation. BioSound was formed as an initiative of the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). Additional information regarding the goals and objectives of the group can be found at the MBON BioSound site.\n\n\nExploratory Project\nThe group’s initial project begins with a focused initiative to compare acoustic-based biodiversity indices across various ocean environments, paving the way for a broader, more extensive analysis. These efforts aim to generate valuable data products highlighting biological sounds and habitat characteristics in regional ocean and coastal areas, while also providing recommendations for standardizing soundscape metric methods and enhancing standards within the bioacoustic community.\nExplore the data collected during this pilot study via our dashboard:\n\nBioSound Data Exploration Dashboard\nThe analytical workflow for multiple components begins with collecting raw audio files from 8 distinct datasets. These files undergo comprehensive data management steps, including preprocessing and standardization, to enable the extraction of acoustic indices in multiple comparable ways across datasets. Additionally, annotations of vessel activity and, where feasible, organismal occurrences are integrated with environmental data to provide context for the acoustic recordings. Subsequently, the processed data are incorporated into a user-interactive dashboard designed for evaluating data across sites and indices. This dashboard facilitates comprehensive exploration and analysis, enabling researchers to gain insights into the relationships between acoustic indices, environmental factors, and biological activity across diverse marine environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Datasets\nThe datasets utilized in this study originate from diverse environments, including offshore, mangrove, and reef ecosystems, spanning both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These datasets have been contributed by members of the BioSound working group, highlighting a collaborative effort to incorporate acoustic data from various marine habitats for comprehensive analysis. Below, a map and table delineate the specific datasets employed in this study, providing geographic context and detailed information about each dataset’s characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Name\nSource\nMarine Ecosystem Type\nNative Sampling Rate\nNative Duration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Data\nSeascapeR, a powerful tool developed by the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), offers extensive capabilities for analyzing and visualizing marine habitat data.

    "text": "Data Management Requirements\nComparing acoustic data from different regions and providers can be complex due to variations in sampling rate, file duration, and file naming conventions. Differing sampling rates can affect the resolution and frequency content of recordings, while variations in file duration may influence the amount of data available for analysis. Additionally, inconsistencies in file naming conventions can hinder data organization and interoperability, requiring careful preprocessing and standardization efforts to ensure accurate and meaningful comparisons across datasets.\nThe following were:\n\nOne\nTwo\nThree\n\nThese are the steps:\nBuffers created with 0.55 degrees which works out to an approximate 60 km by 60 km regions surrounding each hydrophone.",

    "text": "Soundscape Metrics\nSoundscape measurements refer to the quantitative analysis of the sounds present in a particular environment, capturing not only individual sounds but also their patterns, frequencies, and intensities over time. These measurements are important in relation to biodiversity indices for several reasons:\n\nIndicator of Biodiversity: The diversity and composition of species within an ecosystem can be inferred from the soundscape. Different species produce distinct sounds, and the presence or absence of certain sounds can indicate the presence or absence of particular species. For example, the diversity of bird calls in a forest can be used as an indicator of avian biodiversity.\nNon-invasive Monitoring: Soundscape measurements offer a non-invasive way to monitor biodiversity. Unlike traditional methods such as trapping or visual surveys, which can be disruptive and time-consuming, recording and analyzing soundscape data can be done remotely and continuously, providing valuable insights into biodiversity without disturbing the ecosystem.\nTemporal and Spatial Dynamics: Soundscape measurements capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of biodiversity. By analyzing changes in sound patterns and intensity over time and across different locations within an ecosystem, researchers can identify patterns of species activity, migration, and distribution, providing a more comprehensive understanding of biodiversity dynamics.\nEarly Warning System: Changes in the soundscape can serve as an early warning system for ecosystem health. Alterations in sound patterns, such as the decline or disappearance of certain species’ vocalizations, can indicate disturbances or threats to biodiversity, such as habitat loss, pollution, or invasive species encroachment, allowing for timely intervention and conservation efforts.\nIntegration with Biodiversity Indices: Soundscape measurements can be integrated with traditional biodiversity indices to enhance their accuracy and comprehensiveness. By combining acoustic data with other ecological data, such as species abundance and habitat characteristics, researchers can develop more robust biodiversity assessments that capture the full spectrum of biodiversity within an ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic-based Biodiversity Indices\nFor this exploratory study we use the package scikit-maad, a tool commonly used in the terrestrial community. Scikit-maad, short for “Machine learning for Acoustic Activity Detection,” is a Python package designed for the analysis of acoustic data, particularly for bioacoustic applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions for processing, extracting features from, and analyzing soundscape recordings. Scikit-maad is primarily focused on facilitating the use of machine learning techniques for tasks such as acoustic event detection, species classification, and biodiversity monitoring.\nThe developers of scikit-maad are a team of researchers and developers passionate about bioacoustics and computational ecology. They have expertise in signal processing, machine learning, and ecology, and their aim is to provide accessible and powerful tools for analyzing acoustic data and advancing research in the field of bioacoustics. The development of scikit-maad is supported by contributions from the open-source community and collaborations with researchers and practitioners in various domains related to acoustic ecology and biodiversity monitoring.\nBelow is a summary of the available spectro-temporal features, alpha acoustic indices, temporal features, and spectral features in scikit-maad:\nSpectro-Temporal Features:\n\nSpectral Band Envelope Statistics:\n\nDescription: Statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) of the spectral envelope within predefined frequency bands.\n\nSpectral Flux:\n\nDescription: Measures the rate of change in spectral energy over time, indicating the dynamics of spectral content.\n\nSpectral Flatness:\n\nDescription: Quantifies the flatness or tonality of a spectrum, indicating the balance between noise-like and tonal components.\n\nSpectral Kurtosis:\n\nDescription: Measures the peakedness or sharpness of spectral peaks, providing information about the distribution of energy across frequencies.\n\nSpectral Roll-off:\n\nDescription: Frequency below which a certain percentage (e.g., 95%) of the total spectral energy is contained, indicating the spectral cutoff frequency.\n\n\nAlpha Acoustic Indices:\n\nAcoustic Complexity Index (ACI):\n\nDescription: Measures the complexity of the acoustic environment by analyzing temporal patterns and variability of sound energy across frequency bands.\n\nAcoustic Diversity Index (ADI):\n\nDescription: Measures the diversity of acoustic events within a recording, considering both richness and evenness of acoustic activity.\n\nAcoustic Evenness Index (AEI):\n\nDescription: Evaluates the evenness of acoustic activity distribution within a recording, indicating the balance among different types of events.\n\nAcoustic Presence Index (API):\n\nDescription: Indicates the presence or absence of acoustic events within a recording, providing a binary measure of activity.\n\nAcoustic Rarity Index (ARI):\n\nDescription: Measures the rarity of acoustic events within a recording, considering the frequency and distribution of occurrence.\n\n\nTemporal Features:\n\nInter-Event Intervals (IEI):\n\nDescription: Measures the time intervals between successive acoustic events, providing insights into event timing and rhythm.\n\nSound Event Duration (SED):\n\nDescription: Duration of individual sound events, indicating their temporal extent and persistence.\n\nSound Event Rate (SER):\n\nDescription: Rate of occurrence of sound events over time, providing a measure of activity intensity.\n\nTemporal Envelope Statistics:\n\nDescription: Statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) of the temporal envelope of sound signals.\n\n\nSpectral Features:\n\nBand Energy Ratios (BER):\n\nDescription: Ratios of energy within different frequency bands, providing insights into spectral energy distribution.\n\nFrequency Modulation (FM):\n\nDescription: Measures the rate of change in frequency over time, indicating the presence of frequency modulation in signals.\n\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC):\n\nDescription: Coefficients derived from the mel-frequency cepstrum of a signal, capturing spectral characteristics important for speech and audio processing.\n\nSpectral Centroid:\n\nDescription: Center of mass of the power spectrum, indicating the “brightness” or average frequency of a signal.",
