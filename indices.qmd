### Soundscape Metrics

Soundscape measurements refer to the quantitative analysis of the sounds present in a particular environment, capturing not only individual sounds but also their patterns, frequencies, and intensities over time. These measurements are important in relation to biodiversity indices for several reasons:

1.  **Indicator of Biodiversity**: The diversity and composition of species within an ecosystem can be inferred from the soundscape. Different species produce distinct sounds, and the presence or absence of certain sounds can indicate the presence or absence of particular species. For example, the diversity of bird calls in a forest can be used as an indicator of avian biodiversity.

2.  **Non-invasive Monitoring**: Soundscape measurements offer a non-invasive way to monitor biodiversity. Unlike traditional methods such as trapping or visual surveys, which can be disruptive and time-consuming, recording and analyzing soundscape data can be done remotely and continuously, providing valuable insights into biodiversity without disturbing the ecosystem.

3.  **Temporal and Spatial Dynamics**: Soundscape measurements capture the temporal and spatial dynamics of biodiversity. By analyzing changes in sound patterns and intensity over time and across different locations within an ecosystem, researchers can identify patterns of species activity, migration, and distribution, providing a more comprehensive understanding of biodiversity dynamics.

4.  **Early Warning System**: Changes in the soundscape can serve as an early warning system for ecosystem health. Alterations in sound patterns, such as the decline or disappearance of certain species' vocalizations, can indicate disturbances or threats to biodiversity, such as habitat loss, pollution, or invasive species encroachment, allowing for timely intervention and conservation efforts.

5.  **Integration with Biodiversity Indices**: Soundscape measurements can be integrated with traditional biodiversity indices to enhance their accuracy and comprehensiveness. By combining acoustic data with other ecological data, such as species abundance and habitat characteristics, researchers can develop more robust biodiversity assessments that capture the full spectrum of biodiversity within an ecosystem.

### Acoustic-based Biodiversity Indices

For this exploratory study we use the package scikit-maad, a tool commonly used in the terrestrial community. [Scikit-maad](https://scikit-maad.github.io/#), short for "Machine learning for Acoustic Activity Detection," is a Python package designed for the analysis of acoustic data, particularly for bioacoustic applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions for processing, extracting features from, and analyzing soundscape recordings. Scikit-maad is primarily focused on facilitating the use of machine learning techniques for tasks such as acoustic event detection, species classification, and biodiversity monitoring.

The developers of scikit-maad are a team of researchers and developers passionate about bioacoustics and computational ecology. They have expertise in signal processing, machine learning, and ecology, and their aim is to provide accessible and powerful tools for analyzing acoustic data and advancing research in the field of bioacoustics. The development of scikit-maad is supported by contributions from the open-source community and collaborations with researchers and practitioners in various domains related to acoustic ecology and biodiversity monitoring.
